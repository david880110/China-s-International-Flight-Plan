Many infectious diseases wax and wane with the seasons. Flu typically arrives with the colder winter months, as does the norovirus vomiting bug. Others, such as typhoid, tend to peak during the summer. Measles cases drop during the summer in temperate climates, while in tropical regions they peak in the dry season.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, many people are now asking whether we can expect similar seasonality with Covid-19. Since it first emerged in China around mid-December, the virus has spread quickly, with the number of cases now rising most sharply in Europe and the US.

This analysis picks [Los Angeles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles) and [New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City) for instance to visualize how the new cases confirmed in each city related to their weather temperature respectivily

## Discussion
Based on the data given, we can clearly tell that the new cases confirmed and weather temparature has positive correlation, however, the weather temperature itself does not serve as the only factor to drive the new cases, other factors such as government's involvement to implement stay-at-home policy and people's engagement in social distancing also helps the mitigation.
